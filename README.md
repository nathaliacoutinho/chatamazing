# Chatzamazing

This is a simple ReactJS chat application, that mocks the login of users and allow them to send messages in existing conversations (personal and group chats)

## Installation

First things first. Run in the terminal

```bash
npm install
```

There is an .env.example file in the root, meant for you to copy and set your own API data. You will need to do that before anything, to fetch data from the API. After that, just go ahead and start the server by running:

```bash
npm start
```
